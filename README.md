# Digit_ros_interface
In this repository, I included the DIGIT tactile sensors within a ros workspace. 

DIGITs are a type of tactile sensors designed by Meta. This type of sensor is low-cost and returns a colour image instead of a force value. If you want to know more about these sensors, you can check the original paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14679) and my last work with them (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pablo-Gil-4/publication/354696829_Touch_Detection_with_Low-Cost_Visual-Based_Sensor/links/617d228aa767a03c14d02b5b/Touch-Detection-with-Low-Cost-Visual-Based-Sensor.pdf).

These sensors works with a library in python3, so I wanted to create a ros workspace compiled with python3 to include these sensors with the rest of our mobile manipulator robot.
